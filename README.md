Kanto Expansion Pak
===================
This is a ROM Hack of Pokémon Red and Blue, aiming to expand the Kanto region with more interesting locations, evolutions added in later generations, and QoL changes.

New Pokemon:
====
- The 34 known beta Pokemon that were cut from RBY have been fully implemented.
- Evolutions or Pre-evolutions of a Kanto Pokemon found in a future generation are included; eg. Kleavor, Glaceon
- Evolutions or Pre-evolutions of a Kanto Pokemon found in the SpaceWorld '97 demo are included; eg. Madaamu, Pudi
	- note that for Pokemon that appeared in the Spaceworld '97 demo and had their sprite design altered, the sprite from SW97 was used instead

New Types:
====
- Dark, Steel and Fairy types are added
	- note that Dark and Steel use their type effectiveness from the SW97 demo
	- note that Bite is still Normal-type
	- note that the Magnemite, Cleffa, Mime Jr, and Igglybuff lines are not Steel or Fairy-type, respectively
		- this (and Bite) was done to ensure the original Kanto Pokemon were unaltered in any way

Type Matchups for Steel and Dark for reference:
- Steel...
	- Attacks are Super Effective vs: Rock, Fairy
	- Attacks are Not Very Effective vs: Water, Electric
	- Attacks do no Damage vs: Steel
	- Pokemon are weak to: Water, Electric
	- Pokemon resist: Poison, Rock, Fighting, Fairy
	- Pokemon are Immune To: Steel
- Dark...
	- Attacks are Super Effective vs: Ghost, Psychic, Dark
	- Attacks are Not Very Effective vs: Normal, Fairy 
	- Pokemon are Weak to: Normal, Dark, Fairy 
	- Pokemon resist: Ghost, Psychic

New Items:
====
- The Sun, Ice, Poison and Heart Stones have been added.
- The Protector and Black Augurite evolution items have been added.
- The Citrine Pass has been added, allowing access to a new post-game area based on the unused "C" map.
- The Old Sea Chart has been added, allowing access to Faraway Island and Mew.
	
Improved areas
====
- Rock Tunnel has a more workable map, now being easier to go through and having new areas to explore. Includes a way to get renewable fossils, items, and other interesting bits and pieces. Overall, it makes Flash much more rewarding to bring, showing you where the items and content are instead of being an inconvenience. 
- It is now possible to go back through Mt. Moon after reaching Cerulean City, allowing for players to backtrack to get items they missed. Additionally, it is now possible to go directly to Rock Tunnel, skipping Misty and Surge.
- Diglett's Cave has a more detailed map, including a platform that has a static encounter.
- Route 25 has been altered slightly to make reference to Bill's Lighthouse from the anime!
- Cinnabar Island is a lot bigger, and has a new location added to it.
- Pokemon Tower was shortened as its old length was excessive.
- Silph Co's pathing was completely overhauled to make navigating it less tedious.
- Viridian Gym now has a new area once you make Giovanni leave.
- The S.S. Anne now returns after getting your fourth badge!
- Once you've entered the Hall of Fame, try visiting Route 1...

New areas
====
- Celadon University is just north of Celadon.
	- This is a reference to a Magikarp event from July 1998, and includes the lore from it and other areas of Pokemon's early worldbuilding.
	- This area also contains a Trade-back NPC to let you get trade evolutions.
	- There are also some trainers here you can battle infinitely for EXP and money.
- Citrine City is a new island city that can be accessed in the postgame.
- Underwater Tunnel connects Route 25 and Route 10.
- Cinnabar Volcano is a new area that houses Moltres, allowing it to be obtained before Victory Road.
- Faraway Island from Pokemon Emerald has been added, where you can find Mew. It also has its own wild encounters, as well as an improved translation on its sign, enhancing its appearance from its source material.
- Silph Co. holds a special challenge for Pokemon League Champions...


QoL Enhancements
====
- All 217 (current) Pokemon can be obtained without the use of trading or glitches, including Mew!
- New Pokedex entries for most Pokemon are available, sourced from the original 1996 Pokedex book by Creatures Inc., restoring a ton of old Kanto lore. Thanks to [Dr. Lava and Nob Ogasawara](http://lavacutcontent.com/1996-creatures-pokedex-translation-1/) for their incredible work translating and writing about it!
- Fast text has no frame delay between text scrolling, doubling the scroll speed. It's also been made the default option, so you don't need to go into the Options menu for it.
- HP bar has been doubled in speed, having a 1 frame delay per pixel rather than 2.
- Trainer DVs are perfect-15s.
- The protagonist is referred to in a gender neutral manner.
- PC added to Celadon Hotel where the invisible event usually is. Why not?
- Artificial Save Delay has been removed.
- Ultra Balls now have a Ball Modifier of 4, instead of 8. This makes them better for general-purpose than Great Balls. Safari Balls have the same effect applied. 
- Event moves can now be taught via TM/HM;
	- TM16 (Pay Day) can be taught to Fearow and Rapidash ('98 Shogakukan)
	- TM23 (Dragon Rage) can be taught to Magikarp (July '98 Shogakukan)
	- HM02 (Fly) can be taught to the Pikachu line (Corocoro)
	- HM03 (Surf) can be taught to the Pikachu line (Stadium / Corocoro)
	- Psyduck learns Amnesia at Lv15 (Stadium)
- Yellow learnset changes are imported; eg. Flash Venonat
- The Game Corner in general is massively buffed, making everything far more worth going for;
	- 3x Cherry now gives 100 coins (used to be 8)
	- 3x Magikarp/Poliwag/Bird/Diglett/Rattata/Jigglypuff now gives 200 coins (used to be 15)
	- 3x BAR now gives 500 coins (used to be 100)
	- 3x 7s now gives 999 coins (used to be 300)
- Game Corner prizes have been altered;
	- Version parity is done across prizes, using Blue's superior prices.
	- New prizes across both versions include: Cubone, Blastyke, and Cactus.
	- The Moon Stone is available over TM23 (Dragon Rage). Dragon Rage has been moved to Celadon Mart, over Take Down, which can still be obtained in Silph Co.
- The Route 5-6 underground path contains a shortcut to Celadon City. 
	- This allows you to skip Route 9 and Rock Tunnel, making them optional areas and opening up central Kanto.
- Press A beside surfable water, strength boulders or cut trees to use the HMs without needing to go into the Party menu.
- Running Shoes by holding B. Also works with the bike! Surf speed is also doubled.
- Bag has capacity for 30 items.
- Spinner tiles move faster.

Bug Fixes
====
Many non-multiplayer, non-battle related bugs have been fixed. The aforementioned have been preserved for the RBY battle experience. Bugs that are fixed are ones that objectively hurt the gameplay experience. Much of this can be attributed to [the tutorials](https://github.com/pret/pokered/wiki/Bugs-and-Glitches) made by the good people at pret.
- Fixed various translation errors (eg. Route 14 Birdkeeper's "birds of prey" line, Koji and Atsuko in Fuschia.)
- Blaine is no longer addicted to Super Potions.
- CoolTrainerF no longer switches a lot.
- Transformed Pokemon aren't presumed to be Dittos! (very important given Animon)
- Status curing items don't remove modifiers anymore.
- Learning new moves plays the sound in the correct bank.
- Falling through a hole on a bike now properly resets the music, as you fall off a bike when going down.
- Using an Escape Rope no longer shows weird characters on DMG and spins correctly on DMG.
- The Item Finder will correctly find items at X/Y 0.0
- Glitch Pokémon will no longer corrupt the Hall of Fame.
- Strength smoke puffs now show properly.
- Game Corner has a ton of fixes;
	- The slots no longer load too many tiles
	- The lucky machine stops when it should if there's a 7
	- The 40-coin hidden item is fixed, and there can always be a lucky machine.
	- and a few other objective fixes.
- 2 invisible stars that show on the title screen are cut off; also, the "presents" logo from RG is re-used!
- The healing machine animates correctly! 
- Using Minimize or Substitute, looking at the Pokedex, and then battling won't cause sprite corruption.
- OAM Updates can no longer be interrupted by V-Blank, avoiding some sprite corruption.
- Trainer Card transition no longer shows weird garbage on DMGs; this was due to not having enough time to load properly.
- Battle victory music plays at the right time; there were some situations where it would happen when you lost.
- Music in Oak's Lab is delayed a frame so it always plays with the correct channels; V-Blank could otherwise interrupt it.
- The hidden item sfx no longer gets cut off sometimes
- The audio engine no longer borrows from the high bytes of the wrong frequency.
- Oak no longer has his line overwrite itself when giving Poke Balls.
- Player correctly faces the Route 8 guard when stopped.
- Weird behaviour when going to 11F in Silph Co. and forcing a player to leave despite not moving is fixed.
- Fixed weirdness in Pokemon Tower where saving Mr. Fuji won't immediately let you leave. Also fixed coord termination on 2F which could cause some terribleness.
and more!

Known Bugs
====
- Only portions of spinner tiles animate.
- Occasionally, menu text sets itself to scroll.
- Some sprites in the Celadon University area spawn bugged out on certain emulators.
- Battling multiple of the trainers in Celadon University causes a crash when attempting to go to Route 16
- The lone Rocket in Viridian Gym's basement needs to be directly spoken to to be battled
- Faraway Island Inside can't be entered
